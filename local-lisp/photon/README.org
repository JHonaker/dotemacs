* Photon.el

Photon.el is inspired by the Emacs package Avy and the Vim plugin lightspeed.vim.

I really like Avy, but there were some changes that I wanted to see. I
wasn't a huge fan of the way keys are assigned. I think it should
operate much closer in behavior to I-search, where you write the text
you want to go to. If it's still ambiguous, then keys can be used to
disambiguate the destination.

I know Avy has goto-timer, but the small delay ended up being much
more of a nuisance than I anticipated.

I am also a really big fan of the immediate feedback that lightspeed
has through the progressive highlighting and desaturation.

This package is my attempt to recreate much of the functionality of lightspeed.vim in Emacs.

I'm using this mostly as a learning opportunity as well. I'm
attempting to develop this in as functional of a style as I can.

The goal is ultimately to provide an Embark based ``act anywhere''
functionality that is built from the ground up with that in mind.
